Created a clone of BASIC Interpreter in C++. I used OOP Conceptssuch as inheritance, composition, classes/structs, and polymorphism. I used inheritance to derive the needed statements from the statements class. In each statement, I implemented the virtual function execute to ensure that the program ran since the statement class was a pure virtual. I also used composition when needed as GoSub, Return, and the If statements all used a "has-a" relationship with the GoTo class. In the the parseLine function of Interpreter.cpp, I made sure to correctly implement a stringstream to take in compatible variables as some were ints and some were strings, while skipping white space. I added header and .cpp files for each of the statements that needed to be completed, and when I needed to access a private variable from ProgamState, I creaded a public function for the statement classes to use. I also implemented a map STL into Program state to keep track of variable names and their values, as well as use a stack ATL to push and pop vaules during my GoSub and Return statements.
